        <p>A few years ago, I was at a conference about annotation on the web, and I had a <a href="http://www.kevinmarks.com/fragmentions.html>minor epiphany</a>. I realised that in many ways the best way to link to text is to quote a meaningful chunk of it.
        Nowadays it’s easier to search for text than link to it, especially as links decay.
        <p>We're used to searching the web, and searching within the page we're reading for the key phrase now. However, to link to text within a page we have to use a pre-existing <code>id</code> or <code> a name</code> that the author put there in advance.
        <p>What if we could just link to some text within the page, and have the browser scroll to it?
