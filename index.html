    <main class="e-content"><h3>Preamble</h3>
        <p>A few years ago, I was at a conference about annotation on the web, and I had a <a href="http://www.kevinmarks.com/fragmentions.html">minor epiphany</a>. I realised that in many ways the best way to link to text is to quote a meaningful chunk of it.
        Nowadays it’s easier to search for text than link to it, especially as links decay.
        <p>We're used to searching the web, and searching within the page we're reading for the key phrase now. However, to link to text within a page we have to use a pre-existing <code>id</code> or <code> a name</code> that the author put there in advance.
        <p>What if we could just link to some text within the page, and have the browser scroll to it?
        <p>I wrote it up and talked  about it, indieweb people made a plug-in and it got some minor interest.
        <h3>Welcome Google</h3>
        <p>About a year ago, a <a href="https://chromestatus.com/feature/4733392803332096">proposal popped up</a> from Google Chrome to do something similar- they wanted to link to bits of text in a page from search results.
        <p>As they get to ship the most-used browser in the world, they can drive adoption of these kinds of things, and so their <a href="https://github.com/WICG/scroll-to-text-fragment>rather more complex proposal</a> is now shipping.
        <h3>Fun with linking</h3>
        <p>One different with their spec is that it doesn't just link to the containing element, it highlights the linked words in the text (though their <a href="https://github.com/WICG/scroll-to-text-fragment#:~:text=an%20example%20URL">example URL</a> no longer works, as the linked-to wiki page changed).
        <p>They also made it possible to link to multiple separate runs of text, word by word, and highlight those.
